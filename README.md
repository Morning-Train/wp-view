# Introduction

## Getting Started

To get started install the package as described below in [Installation](#installation).

To use the tool have a look at [Usage](#usage)

### Installation

Install with composer

```bash
composer require morningtrain/wp-view
```

## Dependencies

### illuminate/view

[illuminate/view](https://github.com/illuminate/view)

### morningtrain/php-loader

[PHP Loader](https://github.com/Morning-Train/php-loader) is used to load and initialize all Hooks

## Usage

For an overview see the [official Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/views)

### View directory

To set the main directory for views

```php
\Morningtrain\WP\View\View::setup(__DIR__ . "/resources/views");
```

### Render a view

```php
echo \Morningtrain\WP\View\View::render('person',['name' => 'John','email' => 'john@doe.com']);
```

### Working with namespaces

You may register a namespaced for a set of views. This is especially useful when writing plugins as you may group all
your plugin views and not worry about duplicate naming. Views in a namespace may be overwritten in the main namespace as
long as you use `first()` instead of `render()`.

Eg. `View::first(['vendor/myPlugin/myview','myPlugin::myview])` will render from the vendor dir first if the view
exists, thereby allowing theme authors to overwrite this view when necessary.

#### Registering a namespace

```php
echo \Morningtrain\WP\View\View::addNamespace('myPlugin', __DIR__ . "/resources/views");
```

#### Using a namespace

```php
echo \Morningtrain\WP\View\View::render('myPlugin::person',['name' => 'John','email' => 'john@doe.com']);
```

### Custom @directives

This package contains some custom [blade directives](https://laravel.com/docs/blade#blade-directives) that you may use:

#### @wpauth()

```php

<div>
  @wpauth()
    Hello @username!
  @else
    <a>Login</a>
  @endwpauth
</div>
```

#### @header()
Acts the same as : https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_header/

The following will render the `header.blade.php` view or `header-small.blade.php`  
```php
@header()
@header('small')
```

#### @footer()
Acts the same as : https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_footer/

The following will render the `footer.blade.php` view or `footer-dark.blade.php`
```php
@footer()
@footer('dark')
```

#### @script()
An easy way to enqueue an already registered script.

Using this directive is the same as calling `wp_enqueue_script()` with only the handle.

```php
@script('swiper')
<section id="my-cool-slider">
  ...
</section>
```

#### @style()
An easy way to enqueue an already registered stylesheet.

Using this directive is the same as calling `wp_enqueue_style()` with only the handle.

```php
@style('employees')
<section id="employees" class="employees list">
  ...
</section>
```
#### @username()
Prints the username of the currently logged in user or an empty string if no one is logged in.

#### @react()

Prints a Morningtrain ReactRenderer compatible element with optional props.
This makes it easy to prepare components for react to handle in the client.

```php
@react('myComponent', [
'someData' => 'someValue'
])
```
